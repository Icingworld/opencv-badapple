process video with python-opencv

library needed:python-opencv、numpy

1、download the video to be processed: https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1Wx411c7JT/

2、run main.py

3、waiting for enough enough enough time (about Emmmm... 7 HOURS) for the algorithm processing the video frames is ergodic.
Using multithreading maybe better.

converted pictures will be in Directory "pic/"
the video created will be in home directory
